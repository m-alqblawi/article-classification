# Text Classification Project

This project involves classifying text documents into different categories. The dataset used in this project contains articles and their corresponding categories.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.7+
- Scikit-learn
- Spacy
- Gensim
- FastText
- Pandas
- Numpy

## Data Preprocessing

The text data is preprocessed by removing stop words, punctuation, and performing lemmatization. The preprocessed text is then converted into numerical features using different word embedding techniques.

## Word Embedding Techniques

The following word embedding techniques are used in this project:

- TF-IDF
- CountVectorizer
- FastText
- Spacy
- Word2Vec

## Models

The following models are used for classification:

- Multinomial Naive Bayes
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)

## Evaluation

The models are evaluated using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.

## Usage

To run the project, execute the Jupyter notebook. Make sure to install all the dependencies before running the notebook.
